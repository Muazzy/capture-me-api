##TODO
  what's remaining that essential? 
    first of all look into how the scheduling or delayed jobs work in node
    then according to that modify the user input that you're taking from the user
    then store that data to db for later refrences
    finally get a good looking email template
    finally for demonstraion, a UI would be great!!
    
        AND THATS IT~~~~
