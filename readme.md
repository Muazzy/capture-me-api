##TODO
  what's remaining that essential? 
    <!-- first of all look into how the scheduling or delayed jobs work in node -->
    <!-- then according to that modify the user input that you're taking from the user -->
    <!-- then store that data to db for later refrences -->
  
    <!-- a route to register for scheduled screenshots -->
      <!-- an email will be sent out as soon as the user registers for a scheduled screensho -->
      
      <!-- a cron job will be created -->

      <!-- and maybe change the status as running -->

    
    <!-- a route to unregister for a scheduled screenshot -->
      <!-- either remove and destroy the cronjob -->
      <!-- or just update the running status to false in db of that scheduled_ss -->
      


    implement cron-parser for validating the cron expression coming from the request &&& implement cronstrue for converting cron expression to human readable format......

    https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-parser
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/cronstrue


    implement mvc and remove this middleware shit for everything. make a fucking controller or something and just keep the paramValidationMiddleware only
